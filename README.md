# iframeLightBox

Do you have something you want users to see without leaving the page? Don't want
to do a lot of fancy AJAXing or annoy your users with popup windows? Maybe you
should try iframeLightBox.

Call it like so:

    <p>Please read the <a href="tos.html" class="pop">terms of service</a>.</p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      iframeLightBox('pop');
    </script>
